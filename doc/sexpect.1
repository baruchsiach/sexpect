.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBsexpect\fP [\fIOPTION\fP] \fISUB\-COMMAND\fP [\fIOPTION\fP]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBsexpect\fP is another implementation of \fBExpect\fP which is specifically
designed for \fBShell\fP scripts (sh, bash, ksh, zsh, ...).
.sp
Unlike \fBExpect\fP (for \fBTcl\fP), \fBExpect.pm\fP (for \fBPerl\fP), \fBPexpect\fP (for
\fBPython\fP) or other similar
\fBExpect\fP implementations, \fBsexpect\fP is not bound to any specific programming
language so \fBsexpect\fP can also be used with other programming languages as
long as they support running external commands.
.sp
Another interesting \fBsexpect\fP feature is that the spawned  process is
running in background.
You can attach to or detach from it as needed (as with \fBGNU screen\fP).
.sp
\fBsexpect\fP is designed in the client/server model.
\(aq\fBsexpect spawn\fP\(aq starts the server (running as a daemon) and runs the
specified \fIPROGRAM\fP in background.
Other \fBsexpect\fP sub\-commands (\fBsend\fP, \fBexpect\fP, \fBwait\fP, ...) communicate to the
server as client commands.
.SH "GLOBAL OPTIONS"
.sp
\-debug | \-d
.RS 4
Debug mode. The server (\fBsexpect spawn\fP) will run in foreground and more
information will be displayed.
.RE
.sp
\-help | \-\-help | \-h
.RS 4
Show brief \fBsexpect\fP help.
.RE
.sp
\-sock SOCKFILE | \-s SOCKFILE
.RS 4
The socket file used for client/server communication.
This option is required for most sub\-commands.
.sp
You can save the \fISOCKFILE\fP in the \fBSEXPECT_SOCKFILE\fP environment variable so
you don\(cqt need to specify the \(aq\fB\-sock\fP\(aq option for each command.
For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
export SEXPECT_SOCKFILE=~/.sexpect\-bash.sock
sexpect spawn bash \-\-norc
\&... ...
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The socket file will be automatically created if it does not exist.
.RE
.sp
\-version | \-\-version
.RS 4
Show \fBsexpect\fP version.
.RE
.SH "SUB\-COMMANDS"
.sp
Sub\-commands may have aliases. For example, \(aq\fBsexpect spawn\fP\(aq can also be
written as \(aq\fBsexpect sp\fP\(aq or \(aq\fBsexpect fork\fP\(aq.
For each sub\-command, the supported aliases are listed in parentheses.
.SS "spawn (sp, fork)"
.sp
\fBsexpect spawn\fP [\fIOPTION\fP] \fIPROGRAM\fP [\fIARGS\fP]
.RS 4
The \(aq\fBspawn\fP\(aq sub\-command will first make itself run as a background
server.
Then the server will start the specified \fIPROGRAM\fP on a new allocated pty.
.RE
.sp
The \(aq\fBspawn\fP\(aq sub\-command supports the following options:
.sp
\-append
.RS 4
See option \(aq\fB\-logfile\fP\(aq.
.RE
.sp
\-autowait | \-nowait
.RS 4
Turn on the \(aq\fBautowait\fP\(aq flag which by default is \fBoff\fP.
See sub\-command \(aq\fBset\fP\(aq for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-close\-on\-exit | \-cloexit
.RS 4
Close the pty after the spawned process has exited even if the spawned
process\(cqs child processes are still opening the pty. (Example: \(aq\fBssh \-f\fP\(aq)
.RE
.sp
\-nonblock | \-nb
.RS 4
Turn on the \(aq\fBnonblock\fP\(aq flag which by default is \fBoff\fP.
See sub\-command \(aq\fBset\fP\(aq for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-idle\-close N | \-idle N
.RS 4
The background server process will close the PTY and exit if there are
no client requests in the last \fIN\fP seconds.
Closing the PTY would usually cause the spawned process to receive
\fBSIGHUP\fP and be killed.
.RE
.sp
\-logfile FILE | \-logf FILE | \-log FILE
.RS 4
All output from the spawned process will be copied to the specified
\fIFILE\fP.
By default the \fIFILE\fP will be overwritten.
Use \(aq\fB\-append\fP\(aq if you want to append to it.
.RE
.sp
\-nohup
.RS 4
Make the spawned process ignore \fBSIGHUP\fP. (Example: \(aq\fBssh \-f\fP\(aq)
.RE
.sp
\-term TERM | \-T TERM
.RS 4
Set the environment variable \fBTERM\fP for the spawned process.
This is useful when the \fBTERM\fP variable is not set (for example for jobs
started by \fBcron\fP/\fBcrond\fP or \fBatd\fP).
.RE
.sp
\-timeout N | \-t N
.RS 4
Set the default timeout for \(aq\fBsexpect expect\fP\(aq.
A negative value means no timeout.
The default value is \fB\-1\fP.
.RE
.sp
\-ttl N
.RS 4
The background server process will close the PTY and exit \fIN\fP seconds
after the process is spawned.
Usually this would cause the process to receive \fBSIGHUP\fP and be killed.
.RE
.sp
Exit status:
.RS 4
\fB0\fP will be returned if the background server has successfully started.
This does not necessarily mean the \fIPROGRAM\fP has been successfully
spawned (e.g. if the specified \fIPROGRAM\fP cannot be found).
Non\-zero will be returned if the server fails to start for some reason.
.RE
.SS "expect (exp, ex, x)"
.sp
\fBsexpect expect\fP [\fIOPTION\fP] [ <[\fB\-exact\fP] | \fB\-glob\fP | \fB\-re\fP> \fIPATTERN\fP] [\fB\-eof\fP]
.RS 4
If the \fIPATTERN\fP is specified, it\(cqll wait until the \fIPATTERN\fP matches
the output of the spawned process.
If \fB\-eof\fP is specified, it\(cqll wait until \fBEOF\fP (end\-of\-file) is seen.
If neither \fIPATTERN\fP nor \fB\-eof\fP is specified, then it defaults to
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
expect \-timeout 0 \-re \(aq.*\(aq
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.sp
The \(aq\fBexpect\fP\(aq sub\-command supports the following options:
.sp
\-cstring | \-cstr | \-c
.RS 4
C style backslash escapes would be recognized and replaced in \fIPATTERN\fP.
See sub\-command \(aq\fBsend\fP\(aq for the list of supported backslash escapes.
.RE
.sp
\-eof
.RS 4
Wait until \fBEOF\fP is seen from the spawned process.
.sp
Note that receiving \fBEOF\fP from the process does not necessarily mean the
process has exited.
.RE
.sp
\-exact PATTERN | \-ex PATTERN
.RS 4
Match the \fIPATTERN\fP as an "exact" string.
.RE
.sp
\-glob PATTERN | \-gl PATTERN
.RS 4
Match the \fIPATTERN\fP as a glob style pattern.
.sp
For convenience, the glob patterns also support \fB^\fP and \fB$\fP which match
the beginning and end of data currently in the internal matching buffer.
.RE
.sp
\-lookback N | \-lb N
.RS 4
Show the most recent last \fIN\fP lines of output so you\(cqd know where you
were last time.
.RE
.sp
\-nocase | \-icase | \-i
.RS 4
Ignore case when matching PATTERN. Used with \(aq\fB\-exact\fP\(aq, \(aq\fB\-glob\fP\(aq or
\(aq\fB\-re\fP\(aq.
.RE
.sp
\-re PATTERN
.RS 4
Match the \fIPATTERN\fP as an extended regular expression (\fBERE\fP).
.RE
.sp
\-timeout N | \-t N
.RS 4
Override the default \(aq\fBexpect\fP\(aq timeout (see \(aq\fBspawn \-timeout\fP\(aq).
.RE
.sp
Exit status:
.RS 4
\fB0\fP will be returned if the match succeeds before timeout or \fBEOF\fP.
.sp
If the command fails, the \(aq\fBchkerr\fP\(aq sub\-command can be used to check if the
failure is caused by \fBEOF\fP or \fBTIMEOUT\fP.
For example (in \fBBash\fP):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
sexpect expect \-re foobar
ret=$?
if [[ $ret == 0 ]]; then
    # Cool we got the expected output
elif sexpect chkerr \-errno $ret \-is eof; then
    # EOF from the spawned process (most probably dead)
elif sexpect chkerr \-errno $ret \-is timeout; then
    # Timed out waiting for the expected output
else
    # Other errors
fi
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.SS "send (s)"
.sp
\fBsexpect send\fP [\fIOPTION\fP] [ [\-\-] \fISTRING\fP | \fB\-file\fP \fIFILE\fP | \fB\-env\fP \fINAME\fP]
.RS 4
The \(aq\fBsend\fP\(aq sub\-command sends data to the spawned process.
.sp
Note that the data to be sent must be less than \fB1024\fP bytes.
To send more data, use multiple \(aq\fBsexpect send\fP\(aq commands.
.RE
.sp
The \(aq\fBsend\fP\(aq sub\-command supports the following options:
.sp
\-cstring | \-cstr | \-c
.RS 4
C language style backslash escapes would be recognized and replaced in
\fISTRING\fP before sending to the spawned process.
.sp
The following standard C language escapes are supported:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\(rs\(rs \(rsa \(rsb \(rsf \(rsn \(rsr \(rst \(rsv
\(rsxHH \(rsxH
\(rsooo \(rsoo \(rso
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Other supported escapes:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\(rse \(rsE : ESC, the escape char.
\(rscX   : CTRL\-X, e.g. \(rscc will be converted to the CTRL\-C char.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.sp
\-enter | \-cr
.RS 4
Append \fBENTER\fP (\fB\(rsr\fP) to the specified \fISTRING\fP before sending to the
spawned process.
.RE
.sp
\-file FILE | \-f FILE
.RS 4
Send the content of the \fIFILE\fP to the spawned process.
.RE
.sp
\-env NAME | \-var NAME
.RS 4
Send the value of environment variable \fINAME\fP to the spawned process.
.RE
.SS "interact (i)"
.sp
\fBsexpect interact\fP [\fIOPTION\fP]
.RS 4
The \(aq\fBinteract\fP\(aq sub\-command is used to attach to the spawned process and
manually interact with it.
To detach from the process, press \fBCTRL\-]\fP .
.sp
\(aq\fBinteract\fP\(aq would fail if it\(cqs not running on a tty/pty.
.sp
If the spawned process exits when you\(cqre interacting with it then \(aq\fBinteract\fP\(aq
will exit with the same exit code of the spawned process and you don\(cqt need
to call the \(aq\fBwait\fP\(aq sub\-command any more.
And the background server will also exit.
.RE
.sp
The \(aq\fBinteract\fP\(aq sub\-command supports the following options:
.sp
\-lookback N | \-lb N
.RS 4
Show the most recent last \fIN\fP lines of output after attaching to the
process so you\(cqd know where you were last time.
.RE
.SS "wait (w)"
.sp
\fBsexpect wait\fP
.RS 4
The \(aq\fBwait\fP\(aq sub\-command waits for the spawned process to complete and
return the spawned process\(aq exit code.
.RE
.SS "expect_out (expout, out)"
.sp
\fBsexpect expect_out\fP [< \fB\-index\fP | \fB\-i\fP> \fIINDEX\fP]
.RS 4
After the \(aq\fBexpect\fP\(aq sub\-command successfully matches the specified
\fIPATTERN\fP, you can use the \(aq\fBexpect_out\fP\(aq sub\-command to get substring
matches.
Up to \fB9\fP (\fB1\-9\fP) RE substring matches are saved in the server side.
\fB0\fP refers to the string which matched the whole \fIPATTERN\fP.
\fIINDEX\fP defaults to \fB0\fP if it\(cqs not specified.
.sp
For example, if the command
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
sexpect expect \-re \(aqa(bc)d(ef)g\(aq
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
succeeds (exits 0) then the following commands
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
sexpect expect_out \-index 0
sexpect expect_out \-index 1
sexpect expect_out \-index 2
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
would output \fBabcdefg\fP, \fBbc\fP and \fBef\fP, respectively.
.RE
.SS "chkerr (chk, ck)"
.sp
\fBsexpect chkerr\fP \fB\-errno\fP \fINUM\fP \fB\-is\fP \fIREASON\fP
.RS 4
If the previous \(aq\fBexpect\fP\(aq sub\-command fails, the \(aq\fBchkerr\fP\(aq sub\-command
can be used to check if the failure is caused by \fBEOF\fP or \fBTIMEOUT\fP.
.sp
See the \(aq\fBexpect\fP\(aq sub\-command for an example.
.RE
.sp
The \(aq\fBchkerr\fP\(aq sub\-command supports the following options:
.sp
\-errno NUM | \-err NUM
.RS 4
\fINUM\fP is the exit code of the previous failed \(aq\fBexpect\fP\(aq sub\-command.
.RE
.sp
\-is REASON
.RS 4
\fIREASON\fP can be \(aq\fBeof\fP\(aq, \(aq\fBtimeout\fP\(aq.
.RE
.sp
Exit status
.RS 4
\fB0\fP will be returned if the specified error \fINUM\fP is caused by the
\fIREASON\fP.
\fB1\fP will be returned if the specified error \fINUM\fP is \fBNOT\fP caused by the
\fIREASON\fP.
.RE
.SS "close (c)"
.sp
\fBsexpect close\fP
.RS 4
The \(aq\fBclose\fP\(aq sub\-command closes the spawned process\(cqs pty by force.
This would usually cause the process to receive \fBSIGHUP\fP and be killed.
.RE
.SS "kill (k)"
.sp
\fBsexpect kill\fP [\-\fISIGNAME\fP | \-\fISIGNUM\fP]
.RS 4
The \(aq\fBkill\fP\(aq sub\-command sends the specified signal to the spawned
process.
The default signal is \fBSIGTERM\fP.
.RE
.sp
The \(aq\fBkill\fP\(aq sub\-command supports the following options:
.sp
\-SIGNAME
.RS 4
Specify the signal with name.
Only the following signal names are supported:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
SIGCONT SIGHUP  SIGINT  SIGKILL SIGQUIT
SIGSTOP SIGTERM SIGUSR1 SIGUSR2
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The \fISIGNAME\fP is case insensitive and the prefix \(aq\fBSIG\fP\(aq is optional.
.RE
.sp
\-SIGNUM
.RS 4
Specify the signal with number.
.RE
.SS "set"
.sp
\fBsexpect set\fP [\fIOPTION\fP]
.RS 4
The \(aq\fBset\fP\(aq sub\-command can be used to dynamically change server side\(cqs
parameters after \(aq\fBspawn\fP\(aq.
.RE
.sp
The \(aq\fBset\fP\(aq sub\-command supports the following options:
.sp
\-autowait FLAG | \-nowait FLAG
.RS 4
\fIFLAG\fP can be \fB0\fP, \fB1\fP, \fBon\fP, \fBoff\fP.
.sp
By default, after the spawned process exits, the server side will wait
for the client to call \(aqwait\(aq to get the exit status of the process and
then the server will exit.
.sp
When \(aq\fBautowait\fP\(aq is turned on, after the spawned process exits it\(cqll
be automatically waited and then the server will exit.
.RE
.sp
\-nonblock FLAG | \-nb FLAG
.RS 4
\fIFLAG\fP can be \fB0\fP, \fB1\fP, \fBon\fP, \fBoff\fP.
.sp
By default, the spawned process will be blocked if it outputs too much
and the client (either \(aq\fBexpect\fP\(aq, \(aq\fBinteract\fP\(aq or \(aq\fBwait\fP\(aq) does not read
the output in time.
.sp
When \(aq\fBnonblock\fP\(aq is turned on, the output from the process will not be
blocked so the process can continue running.
