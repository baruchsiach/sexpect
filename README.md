# What's `sexpect`

`sexpect` is another implementation of [`Expect`][expect].

Unlike [`Expect`][expect] (Tcl), [`Expect.pm`][expect.pm] (Perl),
[`Pexpect`][pexpect] (Python) or other similar
`Expect` implementations, `sexpect` is not bound to any specific programming
languages so it can be used with Shells (`Bash`, `Ksh`, `Zsh`, ...) and any other languages which support running external
commands. **Users who write shell scripts would love this because
they don't have to learn other languages just to use the `Expect` feature.**

Another interesting `sexpect` feature is that the spawned child process is
running in background. You can *attach* to and *detach* from it as needed.
